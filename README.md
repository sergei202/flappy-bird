This is a simple demo that uses neuro-evolution to how to play Flappy Bird.

The genetic algorithm uses basic crossover and a mutation rate of 1%.

TensorFlow.js controls the NN:

- 2 inputs: How far away is the nearest pipe and what far off center
- 4 hidden neurons
- 1 output neuron: This controls the bird flapping
